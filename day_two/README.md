# Learn You A Web Dev

## Day two

Today we covered PHP and Ruby, two server-side programming languages
that can make websites dynamic.

## Ruby

[Ruby][] is an object-oriented, dynamic programming language that
focuses on expressivenss and productivity. It's [easy to try
out][try], and as far as I know it's the only programming language
with [a comic book][poignant].

### song.rb, album.rb

Examples of creating a class in Ruby.

### wick\_it.rb

Examples of creating objects (Songs, Albums), requiring other Ruby
files, and blocks ("do...end"). You can run this file (if you have
song.rb and album.rb in the same folder as wick\_it.rb) by typing in
the command line: `ruby wick_it.rb`.

### sinatra.rb

An example of creating a dynamic website in Ruby using the [Sinatra][]
framework. This website takes two lists of Strings and then creates a
sentence with a random element from each.

The website has some really good documentation, and an even
simpler "hello world" type app.
